# Project-evenOrOdd_homework

This program is about  how to find  odd or even number from given number using function in Javascript.

- Even numbers are those numbers that are exactly divisible by 2, meaning when the number is divided by 2 the remainder becomes zero – eg 2,4,6,8,10
- The remainder operator % gives the remainder when used with a number.
- Hence, when % is used with 2, the number is even if the remainder is zero. Otherwise, the number is odd.
